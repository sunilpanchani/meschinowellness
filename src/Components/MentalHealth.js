        description1: `The Mental Health Check-Up on the Meschino Digital Wellness Platform is based on the DSM-5.
        This is the standard assessment used by psychiatrists to identity existing or impending mental health disorders, including various types of depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia etc.
        The DSM-5 is an abbreviation for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth and most recent edition â€“ 2013).
        Disability from mental health problems account for approximately 35% of all disability claims, and account for 75% of the total cost of all disability claims management.`,
        description2: `Completing the DSM-5 questionnaire notifies individuals trending towards mental health issues to consult their doctor.
        Bringing the printed mental health feedback report aids physicians in starting appropriate treatment, often medication-based, to balance neurotransmitter function.
        This prevents major crises and disability episodes.
        The Meschino Wellness Program offers free peer-support consultations to assist individuals in managing interpersonal conflicts, workplace challenges, environmental triggers, and lifestyle factors contributing to mental health problems.
        Peer-support consultants, previously affected individuals, now trained, help navigate these issues for long-term mental health success.`,
