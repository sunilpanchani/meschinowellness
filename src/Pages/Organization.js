        With over 25 years of clinical experience, the HRA underwent significant updates, culminating in a complete transformation in 2014 to become the engine for the Meschino Wellness Platform.
        Originally designed for doctors, it is the most comprehensive Nutrition/Lifestyle Health Risk Assessment available.
        Unique features include the identification of nutrient deficiencies, drug-nutrient interactions, and nutrient depletion from medications, alcohol, and drugs, setting it apart from other HRAs.`,
        description2: `With over 200 questions, the Meschino HRA requires just 15 minutes, potentially the most impactful quarter-hour of your life.
        The resulting feedback report acts as a personalized roadmap to a fitter, healthier, leaner, more energetic you, empowering you to better manage existing health issues and enhance your prospects for a long, healthy life.
        This information fills a crucial gap in today's healthcare, as nutrition and lifestyle significantly influence your year-to-year health.
        Therefore, everyone should undergo the Meschino HRA and heed the tailored wellness plan it produces.
        To make it easy to understand and digest the report is presented in two sections:`,
